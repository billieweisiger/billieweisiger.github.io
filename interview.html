          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            Before getting placed on assignment through <a href="https://www.employbridge.com/" target="_blank">EmployBridge</a>, job candidates submit an application, have an interview with a recruiter,
            and do any required onboarding paperwork.
            EB is building a new platform for candidates to complete this application / interview / onboarding flow and
            I was responsible for designing the interview experience (scheduling, managing, cancelling, etc.)
            for this.
          </p>
          <h1>My Role</h1>
          <p>
            I was the sole designer on this project and was responsible for all aspects of the design from wireframing through handoff. I
            collaborated closely with a PM and engineers throughout this work.

        <h1>Goals</h1>
          <p>
          The main business goal tied to this work is to <em>increase interview show rate by 15%.</em>
          The research team conducted discovery around the current interview scheduling experience including <em>a survey with 57 respondants & user interviews</em>
          to better understand what contributed to interview no-shows.

        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <h2>Inspiration + early ideation</h2>
          <p>
            I started by reviewing the current process and analyzing scheduling experiences on other sites
            for inspiration. Then I jumped into sketching + low-fidelity wireframing intial ideas.

        <h2>Integrating a vendor</h2>
          <p>
          To build this functionality, we integrated a third party scheduling vendor, TimeTap. It was unclear
          at first how custom we would be able to make the experience for first release. So
          I <em>analyzed the out of the box experience from the vendor</em> and customized
          it as much as possible using their tools, then <em>documented changes our engineers
          would be able to make with CSS.</em>

            <p>
            We ended up being able to build a custom experience, so I used the above screens & my initial wireframes as
            a starting place, <em>incorporated our design system's components</em>, and iterated based on feedback from the UX team.

        <h2>Accounting for all scenarios</h2>
          <p>
            The interview scheduler ended up being a very simple UI - one screen where the user
            selects a date and time. However, this work had implications
            outside of that including - What should the experience be if there's a technical issue with the scheduling service?
            Where should information about the upcoming interview live within the experience? How will a user
            reschedule or cancel an interview? What if a user skips scheduling and tries to move on to
            other tasks?
            <em>I created user flows to zoom out and visualize the holistic experience.</em>

            The research team's findings highlighted the need for all of the information about an upcoming interview
            to be easily accessible, and the rescheduling functionality to be easy to find.

        <h2>Pushing our design system</h2>
          <p>
            Interview scheduling lives in between two other flows - the job application and the onboarding work.
            The entry point into the scheduling flow is the "application success" screen - after a user submits
            a job application, they are taken to a screen letting them know their application is in and prompting them
            to schedule their interview. After their interview is scheduled, the user is taken to a second success
            screen prompting them to continue to onboarding. <br><br>
            The success screens are meant to add pause to the flow, display any relevant information to the user,
            and encourage them to continue on to the next step. <em>The design for these needed to have a pattern that would be flexible enough to work for different use cases.</em>
            I explored different designs, playing around with hierarchy and information architecture.

        <h2>Celebrating the user</h2>
          <p>
            As we showed users where they were at in the process, we also wanted
            to provide encouragement by celebrating the steps they completed. I achieved this by incorporating
            emojis, encouraging copy, and adding in a confetti animation.

        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>
          This work has shipped, is currently live in 5 EB branches, and
          is continuing to roll out. The goal of creating this streamlined scheduling experience
          is to increase interview show rate by 15% (+900 interviews per week). Data is still being collected on that,
          but <em>early success indicators
          show that interviews scheduled have increased 10% and 92% of candidates that create an account
          go on to schedule an interview.</em>
