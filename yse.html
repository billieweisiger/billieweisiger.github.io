            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
              I worked with a team of designers and researchers to redesign the website of Youth Society for Education, YSE, a non-profit
              working to provide education access for underprivileged students.
              The aim of this work was to help increase volunteer interest + donations.
            </p>
            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>
              This project was unfortunately put on hold before implementation.
              Nonetheless, our redesign was given positive feedback during user tests.
              Stakeholders received a high fidelity prototype of a redesign website as well as refined design standards.

        <h1>Discovery</h1>
        <p>
          We started out our process by diving into the problem space.
          The research team conducted a stakeholder interview to learn more about YSE and their needs as well as user interviews focused around
          answering how people learn about YSE, why the engage with YSE and their experience with the current website.
        </p>
        <p>Around the same time as the interviews, the design team and I conducted an analysis of the current site using Jakob Nielson’s
          10 usability heuristics to find areas for improvement. Some issues we found were broken links to their social media pages,
          inconsistent fonts & formatting, a lack of hierarchy which made certain pages feel overwhelming, and language switches
          between English & Burmese.

        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>
          After the initial interviews and the website analysis, we defined the main goals we wanted to target
          with the redesign based on our findings.
          <br>
          1. Make the site more user friendly and visually interesting to engage the website audience.
          <br>
          2. Improve the content of the website - make sure it’s all up to date, organized, and looks professional.
          <br>
          3. Motivate users to get involved by highlighting
          success stories and career development opportunities, since these were key motivators for current volunteers to join. Add
           clarity around donations to improve trust.

        <h1>Initial designs</h1>
        <p>
          At this point, we felt ready to start designing. We knew we wanted to restructure the website because of
          issues with navigation uncovered in discovery, so we started with a sitemap. After this was done, we split up the website pages
          between the design team and started sketching ideas. We sketched these on paper first and critiqued them, then
          converted our ideas into a low-fidelity prototype.

        <h1>Usability testing</h1>
        <p>
          Once we had that low-fidelity prototype, we conducted unmoderated usability testing
          with just over 30 users.
          We particularly wanted feedback on the new architecture of the website as well as
          on the improved donation and project pages.
          <br><br>
          One task given to users was to locate the volunteer page. Less than 50% of the
          users were able to find this page directly, indicating that we needed to change this
          design.

        <h1>High fidelity prototype</h1>
        <p>
          After making changes based on the usability testing, including the one above, we added in content + visual identity to create a
          high fidelity prototype. Before applying visual elements, we improved the existing YSE style guide. Part of
          the inconsistencies in the original website had to do with the fact
          that fonts weren’t standardized across pages. So we defined guidelines for that and added an additional accent color,
          yellow - taken from YSE's logo, to make the website brighter and appear more youthful.

        <p>
          This project was stopped after the high fidelity prototype was built due to issues
          in Myanmar at the time. If this project were to continue, we'd conduct another round of user testing with the high fidelity prototype,
          iterate based on findings, then implement the new website + track metrics.<br><br>
          Although we weren't able to track the performance of this redesign with data, this project
          gave me exposure to problem discovery process, helped me practice quick iteration + design critiques, and helped me learn a remote usability testing tool, Maze.
