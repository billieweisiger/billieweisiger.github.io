          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            EmployBridge is a staffing company that operates by paying workers placed on job assignments for billable clients.
            To ensure we're billing and paying accurately, a subset of colleagues is responsible for fixing pay & bill errors that occur
            outside of the usual payroll cycle, due to reasons such as
            late payroll changes or a client not approving hours before a deadline. <br><br>It was uncovered during earlier payroll-related research
            that the current adjustment process is inefficient and tedious for our colleagues. The goal of this work is to improve that process.

          </p>
          <h1>My Role</h1>
          <p>
            I was the sole designer on this project - responsible for initial ideation, iterating on designs, running usability testing, meeting with stakeholders,
            wireframing, prototyping and handing off designs. I collaborated with a product owner, business stakeholders, UX research, end users, and engineers throughout
            this process.

      <div class="casestudy1 container-md col-md-6">
        <h1>The Problem</h1>
          <p>
          Currently, colleagues create adjustments by filling out
          spreadsheets. This requires them to <em>manually enter a lot of data</em> and <em>visit multiple databases</em> outside of the spreadsheet to find
          necessary information. <em>This workflow requires a lot of steps and is a pain point for our colleagues.</em>
          </p>

          <div class="casestudy1 container-md col-md-6">
            <h1>Design Process</h1>
              <p>
              The product owner put together a flow diagram that outlined the requirements for this project. After reviewing that, other discovery work, and relevant research, I started <em>ideating initial wireframes.</em>
              </p>
          </div>


              <div class="sidebyside container-md col-md-8">

              <div class="casestudy1 container-md col-md-6">
                  <p>
                  I quickly realized I didn't fully understand aspects of the payroll workflow which made it hard to make certain design decisions, so <em>I initiated feedback sessions with SMEs</em> to help improve my wireframes. After a few
                  rounds of iterations with input from them, <em>I built out two prototypes for usability testing</em> - one for each user group (adjustment submitter + adjustment approver).
                  With guidance from the UX research team, <em>I created a research brief, scripts & led 4 usability testing sessions</em> to help validate the designs.

                    The new design eliminates steps and centralizes the adjustment process:

        <h2>Pulling in data</h2>
          <p>
            The ability to pull in and display data so our users don't have to leave the tool and go to other sites was a key component of this work.
            I tried out different lay outs for this and landed on one that would allow users to easily scan the pulled-in data to help inform the adjustment:

        <h2>Minimizing risk of error</h2>
          <p>
            We eventually want to automate some adjustments rather than having them go through the approval process. Because of this, it's important to
            make sure adjustments are getting submitted correctly. <em>I added in a confirmation modal</em> to let a submitter review the adjustment
            and configured the adjustment page so <em>a user can only edit fields related to the adjustment type selected</em> (e.g. they can't edit hours if they're making a rate change).

        <h2>Setting up for a future state</h2>
          <p>
            The focus of this first release is the main use case (standard rate and hour changes). However, we'll eventually build this tool out for other adjustment types. Even
            though those aren't fully supported on this first release, there's a way to submit documentation (i.e. a spreadsheet) for those other adjustments, as a way <em>to encourage users to
            start adopting this system.</em>

        <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>
            This tool is currently in production and is expected to be released later this year. While we don't have metrics to share yet, all of the users from
            usability testing were excited about this tool which is encouraging. <em>To learn more about this project or see a full prototype, contact me below.</em>
