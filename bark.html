          <h3>This project was a submission to the <a href="https://uxresult.com/" target="_blank">UX Result hackathon</a>.
            My team and I took on a challenge sponsered by Leverege focused on
            creating an app to accompany a smart dog collar. View the challenge prompt <a href="https://uxresult.com/hackathon2020/leverege" target="_blank">here.</a>

            design the onboarding process</mark> for the smart collar app.
            Later on, after conducting research, we set additional goals based on features that users need.</h3>

      <h2>Users</h2>
      <h3><mark>Our first step was to talk to dog owners to better understand their wants and needs in this product.</mark>
        In order
        to get as much feedback as possible within our time constraints, we sent out a survey that got
        over 100 responses. We also conducted 4 user interviews. Key findings are below.
      </h3>
      <div class="casestudy_img">
        <img src="./images/barksurvey.png" alt="Results from survey.">
      </div>
      <h3>Based on the findings we established the additional goals of
        <ul>
          <li>Enabling the sharing of a pet's location, since many users have been helped by/have helped others
            when looking for a lost pet</li>
            <li>Creating a health page (to track analytics like a Fitbit for dogs), since many users don't formally
              track their pets' health but are interested in this</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>

      <br>
      <h2>Competitors</h2>
      <h3>Looking at existing products that function similarly, we noted things that did and didn't work well
        to give us design inspiration + identify areas where current products are lacking. You can see our
        comments on <a style='color:black' href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kmStcow=/" target="_blank">this Miro board.</a></h3>

      <h2>Sitemap</h2>

      <h2>Visual identity</h2>
      <h3>After working out usability, we shifted focus to the visual style of Bark.
          We used blue + red as our main colors to combine a sense of security + calmness with a sense of alertness.
          The font “Courier” felt like a callback to type on a typical dog tag so it was used in the logo.
