          <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
          <h3>As part of an interaction design course,
            I was tasked with creating a site
            to address a problem or need related to a personal interest.<br><br>
            Triangle is a music streaming platform designed to foster social
            interaction with your friends.

        <h3>Music can be a very social medium - my friends and I listen to and discuss it,
          travel to see shows together, meet other people through it, etc. However,
          this together-ness can feel lost when streaming music on your own - as a Spotify user,
          I can't even directly send someone a song through the app. This project explores bridging
          that gap to make music streaming less isolating.</h3>

        <h1 style="padding-top:10vh">OUTCOME</h1>
        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 2%">The final outcome of this project was a music
        streaming app with aspects that foster social interaction - like a social media-type feed for songs
        and the ability to listen to + discuss music with your friends from your individual devices (shown below).</h3>

      <h2>Users</h2>
      <h3>My first step was to conduct interviews to better understand how users
        currently interact with music streaming as well as their wants & needs in a new product.
        <em>Every person interviewed expressed an interest in a streaming platform with more social features.</em>
        A couple specific insights were:<br>
        "I like getting music recs based on what I stream, but I'd also like to get them [on an app] from friends."<br>
        "I like Instagram stories + the activity feature on Spotify because I get to see what my friends are up to in
        real time."
      </h3><br>
      <h2>Competitors</h2>
      <h3>Looking at existing sites that related to this project, either by being music- or social media-related,
          I noted things that did and didn't work well to give me design inspiration + identify areas where current
          products are lacking.</h3>

      <h2>Initial wireframes</h2>
      <h3>Inspired by social media platforms + the wants of users
          from interviews, I focused the homepage around friend activity + posts. The music library
          also has unique features like a "sent by friends" playlist populated by songs your friends
          DM you as well as the option to set up a "listening party" to sync music with other devices.</h3>

      <h2>User testing</h2>
      <h3>I conducted usability testing throughout my wireframe iterations to uncover pain points.
        Below are a few insights that led to design changes.

      <h3>This was my first completely solo UI/UX project and,
        although I think I prefer collaborating with teammates, I enjoyed getting the freedom to
        explore a personal interest and I'm proud of the work I created in this assignment. <br><br>
        Due to time constraints and the abrupt shift to working virtually because of shutdowns,
        I wasn't able to get feedback on the final prototype of my app - in particular, the listening party
        user flow which I fully fleshed out towards the end of the project.
        My next step would be a round of usability testing focused on that feature.
